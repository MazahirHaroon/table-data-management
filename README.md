# table-data-management app

A performant React table demo that renders 1000+ rows and supports:

- Row selection with checkboxes
- Search by name or location
- Filter by health (Healthy / Injured / Critical)
- Sort by power (ascending / descending)
- Console action to mark selected rows as "viewed" (logs selected IDs)
- Loading states and accessibility considerations

> NOTE: This is the initial README. I will update this file with full implementation details, deployment link, screenshots, and further instructions once I finish building and pushing the project.
